  The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released a six-paper series revealing the first images and analyses of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Spanning observational details, imaging, variability, astrophysical modeling, and tests of the black hole metric, the collection provides the most complete picture to date of Sgr A*.
