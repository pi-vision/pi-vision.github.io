Supported by the [Data Sciences Institute](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/bridging/), [Aviad Levis](/people/#aviad) is co-leading *Bridging the Gap: From Computational Physics, to Physics-informed Machine Learning, to Data-driven Scientific Discovery*. The DSI Emerging Program unites four co-leads and 16 members across nine departments to connect first-principles simulations with data-driven discovery for high-impact domains—from sustainable design to astrophysics.
