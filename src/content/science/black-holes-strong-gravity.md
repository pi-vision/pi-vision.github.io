title: Black Holes & Strong Gravity
image: /images/focus/black-holes.png
description: Extracting physical insight from observational and simulation data to study black holes, extreme plasma physics, and strong-gravity environments. We develop computational methods for Very Large Baseline Interferomery (VLBI) imaging of event horizons, polarization-based inference of galactic flares, and machine-learning models that learn plasma dynamics from complex simulations.
