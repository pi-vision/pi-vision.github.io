Reconstructing cosmic structure through gravitational lensing to study dark matter, mass distributions, and large-scale processes. Our work integrates physics-informed inference, neural reconstruction, and differentiable rendering, spanning weak lensing and emerging efforts in strong and cluster-scale regimes.
