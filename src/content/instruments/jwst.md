A space observatory for high-resolution infrared imaging. We design differentiable reconstruction methods for JWST coronagraphy and scattered-light imaging, and are developing gravitational-lensing algorithms for future exploration (<a href="https://jwst-venus.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venus program</a>).
