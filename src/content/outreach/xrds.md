Aviad guest-edited the student-led ACM magazine XRDS 31(2), curating a special issue on computational imaging.
His editorial,
[“Seeing the World Through the Lens of Computational Imaging”](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3703395),
traces the journey from early digital photos to today’s physics-aware cameras, highlighting how sensing, rendering,
and machine learning reshape how we *form* images rather than merely record them. The issue introduces students to ideas spanning neural rendering, medical imaging, and black-hole reconstruction, emphasizing how interdisciplinary tools reveal hidden structures.
