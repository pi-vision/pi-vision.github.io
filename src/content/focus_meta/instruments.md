We model and design the next generation of scientific instruments through machine learning and physics-aware computation — enabling breakthroughs in high-resolution imaging and complex inverse problems. Our differentiable models accelerate calibration and enable reconstruction and co-design of the next generation of scientific instruments. By working closely with domain experts we advance new sensing concepts such as cloud tomography and SPAD-based intensity interferometry.
